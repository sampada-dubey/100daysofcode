# 100 Days Of Code - Log | Day 7: June 25, 2022

## Today's Progress

* Completed [FreeCodeCamp.org - Learn CSS Flexbox by Building a Photo Gallery][1]

## Notes

* `box-sizing: border-box`
* `@media (max-width: 500px) {...}` - create specific css for certain screen resolutions
* Flexbox
    * `display: flex` - enable the flexbox rending
    * `flex-wrap` - whether to wrap the content within the element
    * `justify-content` - where to display the content with justification - left, right, or center
    * `align-items` - where to align items
* `object-fit: cover` - have the content as a cover

## Thoughts:

* This example is a good demonstration of creating responsive layout for single column, 2 column and multi-column layout based on the device size using `@media` query
