* Completed [FreeCodeCamp.org - Learn HTML by Building a Cat Photo App][1]

## Notes

* Use `<!DOCTYPE html>` for setting browser compatiblity
* Use `<html lang="en">` to set the language of the page
* `<head>` contains page heading
* `<body>` shows data for the web page
* Headings - `h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, h6`
* Paragraph - `p`
* Comments - `<!-- This is an HTML comment -->`
* `<main>` tags allows for better Search Engine Optimization (SEO) and accessibility
* Lists - Unordered list (`<ul>`) and Ordered list (`<ol>`). Define items with `<li>`
* Image Tag - `<img>` - Shows images on the web page
    * Attribute `src` - Link to the image
    * Attribute `alt` - Text shown in case image fails to load
* Anchor Tag - `<a>` - Creates hyper-link to other web pages
    * Attribute `href` - Creates hyper-link to the specified URL
    * Attribute `target` - Where the hyper-link should open. `_blank` and `_new` represents new tab/window
* Section `<section>` - Creates a section within page
* Figure `<figure>` - Self-contained content and allows to associate an image with a caption
    * `<figcaption>` - A caption text associated with an image
* Formatting
    * `<em>` - Emphasize a text (make it italics)
    * `<strong>` - Makes the text bold faced
* Form `<form>` - Allows to accept input from the user
    * Attribute `action` - URL where the form submits the captured data
* `<input>` - Defines element that accepts user input
    * Attribute `type` defines accepted input type - `text`, `radio`, or `checkbox`
    * Attribute `id` defined the element identifier. Should be unique in whole of the page
    * Attribute `name` defines the variable used to store the input value
    * Attribute `value` defines value associated to the input
    * Attribute `placeholdertext` defines default placeholder value for the input element
    * Attribute `required` marks that user must provides the value
    * To select only one radio button among a group, set `name` attribute of all `<input type="radio">` as same
    * To mark a radio/checkbox as selected by default, set `checked` attribute on `<input>` tag
* `<button>` creates button on the web page
    * Attribute `type="submit"` marks the button as a submit button which can submit the form data
* `<label>` element links the `<input>` element and the display text
    * Option 1: Wrap the `<input>` element with `<label>`
    * Option 2: Use `<label for="element-id">` and `<input id="element-id">` to link
* `<fieldset>` creates a group of form elements together
    * `<legend>` element gives a title text to the fieldset group
* `<footer>` element creates a footer section on the page

## Thoughts:

* Good to remember most elements as learned in past
* New tag - `figure` and `figcaption`
