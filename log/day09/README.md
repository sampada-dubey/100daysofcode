## Today's Progress

* Completed [FreeCodeCamp.org - Learn Accessibility by Building a Quiz][1]

## Notes

* `<meta name="description" content="web page description" />` - Describes the contents of the page for Search Engine Optimization (SEO)
* `role` attribute specifies the purpose behind an element. Complement with `aria-labelledby` attribute as well
* Avoid using `<input placeholder="" />` because placeholder value sometimes confuses with an input value
* `accesskey="<key>"` provides access keys. Activate Access Key with `Alt + Shift + accesskey`
* Use `<address>` tag when providing address information on the page
